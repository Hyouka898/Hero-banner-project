              <p>
                Xiao Yan is the protagonist of "Battle Through the Heavens."
                During his childhood, he was recognized as a genius, but since
                then, he has been referred to as trash. Yao Lao who resided in
                the ring his mother gave to him before she died, took him as a
                disciple and helped him reach the highest level of cultivation
                in his world. He then later sets out on a journey to become
                stronger. At the start, his objective was solely to defeat Nalan
                Yanran but his final goal has risen much higher as his enemies
                are at the top of the "food-chain" and he realizes he will have
                to surpass them. He aims to reach the highest rank, Dou Di
                (Battle God).

              <p>
                Medusa/Cai Lin is one of the main female deuteragonist of Battle
                through the Heavens. She is the queen of the Snake-People Tribe
                and Xiao Yan's first wife.She is very prideful and has
                superiority complex as she wanted other people to address her as
                "Your Highness" or "Queen". Medusa has a soft point towards
                children and admitted that humans are interesting(Only In
                Manhua). She didn't have much respect for Human Life before Xiao
                Yan. She has the traits of a Medusa (A Name meaning Snake Queen,
                i.e. there were various Queen Medusa before her)
